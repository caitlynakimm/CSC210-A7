## Assignment Reflection

Please reflect on your experience with this assignment. What was most challenging? What was most interesting?
- The most challenging aspects of this assignment for me were implementing split feature in the nearMisses method in WordValidation and the method for the file input mode in SpellChecker. I understood the concept of splitting words, but it took a lot of trial and error to think about how to actually code it, and I tried my best to debug my code. Also, it was challenging to learn how to use delimiters to break up lines with multiple words. It took a lot of time for me to understand all the notation and specific symbols to get the formatting I wanted. For the assignment, I decided not to handle capitalization (made all letters in words lowercase).
- The most interesting thing for me was learning how programs such as word processors or spell checkers essentially work from the code I was writing. I thought it was interesting that you could look at parts of a misspelled word and iterate through each letter to see if you needed to delete, add, replace, or swap letters or split a word. It was also cool to see that you could create different modes of user input for spell checking (enter words directly in the command-line or an entire file).
